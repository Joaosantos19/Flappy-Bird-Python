# Flappy-Bird-Python

## Game Description:
The Flappy Bird Python project on GitHub is a clone of the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird." In this game, players control a bird that continuously moves to the right, and their goal is to keep the bird flying as long as possible without colliding with pipes. The primary interaction is pressing the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude, allowing it to navigate through openings in the pipes. The game is simple yet challenging, with the objective of achieving the highest possible score.

## Code Description:
The GitHub project's codebase consists of Python scripts that implement the game's mechanics and features.
